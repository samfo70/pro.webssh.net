!!! abstract "All the help you need when you need it"
    Whenever you need to make a [bug report](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), a [feature request](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=) or to just ask [how to](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=how_to.md&title=), I'm never very far.

!!! tip "External Testers Needed"
    I have added some useful features to WebSSH and now I need [External Testers](/becoming-external-tester), why not you?

!!! success "14.6 - Bicyclist :bicyclist:"
    If you encounter any catastrophic bug :bug:, it's time to submit a [bug report](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) for the upcoming milestone.
    Be advised that some [features have been fully removed](/documentation/changelog/14.6/) in order to allow the development of WebSSH to go forward.
