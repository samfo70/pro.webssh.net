Since two weeks I have removed a lot of dead code :scream: and I have introduced a "pretty" feature inside WebSSH : [mashREPL](/documentation/mashREPL) :boom:

I now need a lot of [External Testers](/becoming-external-tester) to review this new feature, why not you?

The complete list of the done work is available [here](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/milestone/8?closed=1) :eyeglasses: and now let's go to [14.6 - Bicyclist](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/milestone/9) :bicyclist:
